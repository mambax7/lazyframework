## 1. About the Lazy Frame

1. This framework is used to develop modules
2. advantage:
   1. A lot of simplification of grammar, almost no need to write functions yourself
   2. Most functions are done in one line
   3. When there is a change in the database field, the program does not need to be modified
   4. Complete various variable writing, reading and filtering to strengthen security
   5. Adopt a variety of latest features, evolve with XOOPS version
   6. In addition to the built-in automatic function, you can also write it yourself in a traditional way
3. Disadvantages:
   1. It's still under development, maybe some complex functions or interfaces can't be handled automatically
4. In the framework of the object position `tadtools/class/TadMod.php`and`tadtools/class/TadDataMod.php`
5. The general process of development:
   1. Download the blank module, unzip it, put it `modules`down, and modify the module directory name
   2. Create the data table and fill in the comments \(notes must be present\), then export the data table and place it in the sql directory under the module, the name must be mysql.sql
   3. Set up `xoops_version.php`and get the module structure
   4. Set `index.php`or `main.php`get the module function
   5. Modify the name of the template file to fix the presentation part
6. This manual looks like a lot, but in fact, it’s just a lot of explanations, and there are few things to do... it’s easy to do it
