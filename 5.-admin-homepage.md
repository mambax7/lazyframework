# 5. Admin homepage

1. We are on this page to set up and manage events
2. The first part of the template setting \(that is, View\):
   1. According to the file name, find the " model prefix ", if the file is `main.php`, the " model prefix " is `main`\(just remove the file name `.php`\)
   2. Regardless of the front and back, the file name should be named with a different name as much as possible, which is more convenient.
   3. You can also use the following methods to customize the " model prefix " \(when there is a file with the same name in the current background, just put it anywhere in the file\)

      ```text
      $op_prfix = "自訂樣板前置符";
      ```

      Copy

   4. Set the `templates/`lower `op_樣板前置符_xxx.tpl`four physical files as `op_main_xxx.tpl`, so as to match the above-mentioned " template prefix ", and to find the file correctly for output screen.
   5. Respectively modify `templates/`the `op_main_xxx.tpl`four file content `<{$模型資料表_xxx}>`is `<{$my_action_xxx}>`, thus, the content of the frame in order to receive automatically generated for presentation on the screen.
3. Then specify the data table to be used on this page, that is, make this data table a model object to manipulate data.
   1. For example: we want to manage activities, so the `my_action`data table is made into a model object:

      ```text
      $Model = new TadModData('my_action');
      ```

      Copy

   2. For convenience, the default name of the object `$Model`can be modified by itself, for example, it `$Action`may be easier to understand \(remember to change it wherever it is useful\)
   3. For details, please refer to: [https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/modules/tad\_book3/page.php?tbsn=48&tbdsn=1595](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/modules/tad_book3/page.php?tbsn=48&tbdsn=1595)
4. Then change the " primary key " to the primary index of the applied data model table, such as: `action`the primary key of the table \(Primary Key\) " action\_id "
5. At this point, the screen and related functions are roughly completed!
   1. Published interface http: // URL /modules/my\_action/admin/main.php?op=create \(model: `templates\op_main_create.tpl`\) ![](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/image/47/%E7%81%AB%E7%8B%90%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2020-05-28T00-27-21.373Z.png)
   2. List screen http: // URL /modules/my\_action/admin/main.php \(model: `templates\op_main_index.tpl`\) ![](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/image/47/%E7%81%AB%E7%8B%90%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2020-05-28T08-09-29.750Z.png)
   3. Single screen http: // URL /modules/my\_action/admin/main.php?op=show&action\_id=1 \(model plate: `templates\op_main_show.tpl`\) ![](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/image/47/%E7%81%AB%E7%8B%90%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2020-05-28T00-41-56.490Z.png)
   4. Edit screen http: // URL /modules/my\_action/admin/main.php?op=edit&action\_id=1 \(model: `templates\op_main_edit.tpl`\) ![](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/image/47/%E7%81%AB%E7%8B%90%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2020-05-28T00-44-28.429Z.png)
   5. At present, the basic functions have been completed, but there are still some small areas that are not satisfactory. Let's set up other functions and deal with them together.
