# 7. Form component replacement function



1. Form components are self-generated
2. If the generated component is not ideal, or you want to change to another type, you can replace it yourself.
3. You can also use the added function to add more friendly operations to the module
4. For the next unit, the location of the code should be placed below the physical object \(unless otherwise specified\)

   ```php
   $Model = new TadModData('Model Datatable');
   $clean = $Model->clean();
   //The next program syntax is posted here sequentially
   ```

   Copy

   For `clean()`reference see [API Tutorial](https://xoops.gitbook.io/jill-lazy-framework-api/3.tadmoddata-class/3-1-basic-method/3-1-2-filter-received-variables-clean)

5. The functions that can be replaced currently are:
   * [Drop-down menu](https://xoops.gitbook.io/jill-lazy-framework/7.-form-component-replacement-function/7-2-use-the-drop-down-menu-instead) :`use_select('Apply field', $optionArray)`
   * [Radio box](https://xoops.gitbook.io/jill-lazy-framework/7.-form-component-replacement-function/7-3-replace-the-option-value-of-a-single-selection) :`use_radio('Apply field', $optionArray)`

6. The functions that can be added are:
   * [Pull sort](https://xoops.gitbook.io/jill-lazy-framework/7.-form-component-replacement-function/7-1-add-automatic-sorting-and-pull-sorting-functions) :`set_sort('sort field name')`
