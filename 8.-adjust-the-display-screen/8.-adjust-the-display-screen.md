# 8. Adjust the display screen



1. The current list and single data are all automatically generated by the framework, but in fact, you can write your own template file to display the screen you want.
2. If you feel that you are not flexible enough to write, or are too lazy to write, you can make appropriate adjustments through the following methods.
3. For the next unit, the location of the code should be placed below the physical object \(unless otherwise specified\)

   ```php
   $Model = new TadModData('Model Datatable');
   $clean = $Model->clean();
   //The next program syntax is posted here in order
   ```
