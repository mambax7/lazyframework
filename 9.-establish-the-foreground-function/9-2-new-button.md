# 9-2 New button

1. Since the front desk is for registration, there should be a "I want to register" button, so we continue to add:

   ```text
   $Model->add_button('我要報名', '', ['op' => 'create', 'action_id'], ['class' => 'btn btn-sm btn-primary'], ['index', 'show']);
   ```

2. As the list is generated by the `my_action`generate this table, therefore, is to use the default `$Model`model object, therefore, if you want the button added to the list, you use the `$Model`model object `add_button($title)`method.
3. `add_button()`For details, please refer to: [https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/modules/tad\_book3/page.php?tbsn=48&tbdsn=1632](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/modules/tad_book3/page.php?tbsn=48&tbdsn=1632)
