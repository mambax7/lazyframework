# 9-2 New button

1. Since the front desk is for registration, there should be a "Register" button, so we continue to add:

   ```text
   $Model->add_button('Register', '', ['op' => 'create', 'action_id'], ['class' => 'btn btn-sm btn-primary'], ['index', 'show']);
   ```

2. As the list is generated by the `my_action`generate this table, therefore, is to use the default `$Model`model object, therefore, if you want the button added to the list, you use the `$Model`model object `add_button($title)`method.
3. `add_button()`For details, please refer to: see [API Tutorial](https://xoops.gitbook.io/jill-lazy-framework-api/3.tadmoddata-class/3-5-screen-display/3-5-8-add-custom-button-add_button-usdtitle)
